# Fauxica Test Website

This repository contains the code for a simple, static webpage named Fauxica. The webpage is designed as a mock-up for a clothing and apparel e-commerce store. The aim of the project is to serve as a learning resource for HTML and CSS practice.

## Design

The design of the webpage is quite minimalistic, with a focus on typography. The website uses two different fonts imported from Google Fonts - Playfair Display for headings and Poppins for other text. The color scheme is quite simple and relies heavily on black and white.

## Responsiveness

As of now, the webpage is not responsive and may not display optimally on all screen sizes. It is primarily designed for viewing on desktop screens. Making the webpage responsive and optimizing it for various devices such as tablets and mobile phones can be an excellent next step for this project.

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements can be made to expand and enhance the webpage:

1. **Responsiveness**: Adjust the CSS to make the webpage responsive. This ensures optimal viewing across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

2. **Additional Pages**: Currently, the navigation links are placeholders. Building the respective pages for these links can make the website more functional.

3. **Interactive Elements**: Consider integrating interactivity using JavaScript or a JavaScript library like jQuery to make the user experience more engaging.
